    <h1>Building Pipeline for Bioinformatics Data using PluMA</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview and Background</h2>
      <p>The objective of PluMA is to make it easy for developers to create adaptable and lightweight
analysis pipelines. These pipelines allow developers to incorporate new algorithms in their
preferred programming language and debug them alongside other stages in the pipeline that might
use different file formats and programming languages. To achieve this goal, PluMA uses plugins
which are available in a large collection in its plugin pool. These plugins are written in various
programming languages and can be executed sequentially to form a pipeline. PluMA allows users
to easily add, remove, or replace plugins using its user interface. Since plugins are dynamically
loaded, users can download PluMA and only the plugins they require from the plugin pool to
assemble their pipeline. Furthermore, PluMA provides plugins for both CPU and GPU
implementations.</p>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Construct a Pipeline for the Paper “Microbiome analyses of blood and tissues suggest cancer
diagnostic approach | Nature”</p>
      
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of PluMA is to simplify the creation of adaptable and lightweight analysis pipelines that can integrate new algorithms in different programming languages and file formats. PluMA uses plugins, with a collection of pre-existing plugins available, implemented in various programming languages and for both CPU and GPU, that can be run sequentially to form a pipeline. The plugins can be easily added, removed, or replaced through a user interface, and dynamically loaded, enabling users to assemble pipelines quickly and efficiently.

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Motivation</h3>
        <p>The Motivation of PluMA is:
Ø	Interoperability of programming languages
Ø	Handling different file formats
Ø	Testing and debugging within a larger pipeline.
Ø	Flexibility and lightweightness
