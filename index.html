<h1 style="background-color:Gold;">Building Pipeline for Bioinformatics Data using PluMA</h1>

<h2><b> OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND </b></h2>
      <p>The objective of PluMA is to make it easy for developers to create adaptable and lightweight analysis pipelines. These pipelines allow developers to incorporate new algorithms in their preferred programming language and debug them alongside other stages in the pipeline that might use different file formats and programming languages. To achieve this goal, PluMA uses plugins which are available in a large collection in its plugin pool. These plugins are written in various programming languages and can be executed sequentially to form a pipeline. PluMA allows users to easily add, remove, or replace plugins using its user interface. Since plugins are dynamically loaded, users can download PluMA and only the plugins they require from the plugin pool to assemble their pipeline. Furthermore, PluMA provides plugins for both CPU and GPU implementations.</p>

 <h2><b> OBJECTIVE </b></h2>
        <p> The objective of PluMA is to simplify the creation of adaptable and lightweight analysis pipelines that can integrate new algorithms in different programming languages and file formats. PluMA uses plugins, with a collection of pre-existing plugins available, implemented in various programming languages and for both CPU and GPU, that can be run sequentially to form a pipeline. The plugins can be easily added, removed, or replaced through a user interface, and dynamically loaded, enabling users to assemble pipelines quickly and efficiently. Transforming microbiome analysis from individual to community-driven. </p>

<h2><b> DESCRIPTION </b></h2>
      <p> The researchers discovered that they could identify specific patterns of microorganisms in both cancer tissues and blood samples from cancer patients. These patterns, called microbial signatures, were still able to predict the presence of cancer even in early-stage cases and in situations where traditional genetic tests may not be effective. In other words, these microbial signatures were found in both cancer tissues and blood samples, and they were still able to accurately indicate the presence of cancer even in early stages of the disease or when other standard genetic tests may not provide reliable results. Considering the 5 samples each from the below mentioned data from European Nucleotide Archive.

<h2><b> CONCLUSION </b></h2>
      <p>Below mentioned is a pipeline for the Paper “Microbiome analyses of blood and tissues suggest cancer diagnostic approach | Nature” 
	      when raw DNA sequences are given as input and this gives us the classified samples for each biological classification and the types of 
	      microbial signatures that come under each classification to easily identify which sample has which microbial signature 
	      present in his blood and tissues.So, when we considering healthy DNA samples and if any of the sample is classified to these microbial signatures 
	      that means there is a probability that the person is affected with cancer and is in the initial stage Ia or IIC and can be diagnosed in the early stage.</p>

<h2><b> FUTURE WORK </b></h2>
      <p>As we don’t have the data to classify the microbial signature into types of cancer future work is required to identify what type of cancer is present in the DNA Sequences. Below models can be used in future work.</p>
<pre>
Lefse (for a better idea of differentiating taxa)
Networks (for ecological relationships)
Machine Learning (with taxa abundances as features)
</pre>
